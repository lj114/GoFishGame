# Overview

The project proposal is about recreating a simple “Go Fish” card game version as
a computerized program. This document describes and explains the requirements
and applications necessary for the completion of the program we are creating.
The major milestones of the project are the completion and presentation of
Iteration 1, Iteration 2 of the program that include the major methods for the
functionality of the program, and its final presentation.

## Project Purpose, Objectives, and Success Criteria

The purpose of this project is to make a simpler version of the card game “Go
Fish” by playing against an AI in a computerized program. The main objective is
to recreate the mentioned card game to be able to play on our own with access to
a computer.

This project needs to be functionable with a player and an AI programmed that
are playing the card game. To be able to complete that, the program is going to
contain a Player class, an AI class, really similar to the Player class but
randomized. A Card class, a Deck class, and a Game class. Added to that we will
have an interface designed for the game that will help our project be visible.

The project success criteria refer to measurable terms of what should be the
outcome of the project that is acceptable to the end user, customer, and
stakeholder. Or what it is the same, the project success factors consist of
activities or elements that are required to ensure successful completion of the
project. Therefore, our project will be successful when all the game classes are
completed and tested, all the presentations are successfully released, and the
users can rely on the completed game. Our Project is set to be completed in a
specific time at the end of the semester and, in consequence, there are some
scheduled principles stated, such as compartmentalization, defined
responsibilities, outcomes, and milestones.

## Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints

The project is not based on any assumptions, it is based in a known card game
with simple and straight rules. All is controlled and set before the start of
the game. Moreover, the project does not depend on any external factor, except
for a computer with any OS that supports Java and NetBeans (DE-1). It must be
functionable and easy for the user to use and making it simple is a required
feature (CO-1), as well as a functioning AI (CO-2). In addition,
compartmentalization, responsibilities, and milestones are a big part of the
project scheduling (CO-3) and they must be highly considered. Therefore, both
should be constraints. As project success drivers, it is a free cost project
with two students developing it, so it is something where some people are
investing into that will bring success. And quality is an important factor, but
it has some considerable range of degrees of freedom.

## References

No references at this time.

## Definitions and Acronyms

Currently not using any acronyms that need defining.

## Evolution of the Plan

The plan will be reviewed and updated after each milestone.

# Project Organization

## External Interfaces

The only external entity for this project is the CS492 class. The communication
is mainly between group project members and there are some milestones set during
the semester for project presentations.

## Internal Structure

There are two members in this project, both responsible for equally completing
it, and with the same authority, open communication and a set schedule.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Lily Jennings is the team leader and is responsible for submitting the bulk of
the project information into Western Online.

Carla Flores Garcia and Lily Jennings will split all responsibilities, such as
programming, testing and bug fixing, for the project evenly.

We have no stakeholders in this project, as this is a project for CS492.

# Managerial Process Plans

## Start-Up Plans

### Estimation Plan

We used a COCOMOII model to estimate the project size, effort, and cost.

We are using a Gantt chart to schedule the project progress.

The Gantt chart will be reviewed and updated weekly.

### Staffing Plan

Staffing is not required for this project.

### Staff Training Plan

Training is not required as there is no staff.

### Resource Acquisition Plan

Development resources: Two computers with any OS that supports Java and
Netbeans. One computer for each team member. Netbeans is the IDE we are using
for this project. Java is the language being used. Git will be used for version
control between team members.

Test resources: We will be using JUnit with Netbeans to complete our software
testing.

the testing and bug fixes phases of the project development.

## Project Close-Out Plan

There will be a final project presentation to close out the project.

# Technical Process Plans

## Process Model

The product development life cycle we use for the project is Waterfall, it is a
fixed project with set requirements and goals, which makes it fit with this life
cycle model. Some set milestones are the presentations for iteration 1 which
contains the card class and deck class, iteration 2 which contains the player
class and AI class, and the final presentation where we add the game class.
There is a broader specification in the Gantt chart shown previously.

## Methods, Tools, and Techniques

-   Any computer with an OS system that supports JAVA and NetBeans will be the
    hardware and network environments needed for development, test, and
    operation.

-   The Software tool used for the version control of the project is GitHub. The
    source code is written with NetBeans, in addition to the design modeling,
    and IDE of the project.

-   The programming language used during the whole program has been JAVA.

-   The Quality assurance practices, including methods of technical peer review,
    unit testing, debugging tools, defect tracking, integration and system
    testing, and test automation have not been performed yet since it is the
    first phase of our program and we are still working on the coding part.

## Configuration Management Plan

The personnel responsible for establishing the baselines are Carla Flores Garcia
and Lily Jennings, the only members of the project management team. All the
communication is set between those two members and the project is done with the
professor’s supervision, but all times both team members are the responsible
ones to complete the project on the set deadlines. The configuration Management
Plan is pretty basic for this project since it is a small project that does not
require budget, or much staff, or status accounting, or auditing, etc. The
estimated percentage of project effort or number of hours planned for the
configuration of the management activities are four hours a week. The project
schedule is defined in the previous Gannt chart. The project is still in
progress so this section will be updated with some time.

## Quality Assurance Plan

The personnel responsible for performing identified quality assurance tasks are
Carla Flores Garcia and Lily Jennings. It is a free cost project so there is no
budget. The number of hours planned for quality assurance activities is three
hours a week. Some of the elements of quality assurance are testing, which is
implemented for every class in the project program, peer review, that is
performed by the two members of the team, audit, and configuration management
activities explained in the previous section. Quality management is the act of
overseeing all activities and tasks that must be accomplished to maintain a
desired level of excellence and to do that the project includes creating and
implementing quality planning and assurance, with our scheduling and Gannt
chart, and quality control and quality improvement, that it is performed as the
project advances. According to that, there are three major dates in the
project’s scheduling (shown in section 4.5) that determine the targets for the
project, and both members of the team are responsible for its completion.
Reliability, usability, reliability, user experience, all will be factors to
take into account for the quality assurance plan.

## Process Improvement Plan

An improved procedure that could be implemented in our project and that,
consequently, would make it more complex, is the implementation of multiple
users, even from different platforms. We would have to change the player class,
make the AI optional, and make the game available online among other features.
